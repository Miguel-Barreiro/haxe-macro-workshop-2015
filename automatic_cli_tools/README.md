## Key lesson: Build macros for super powered classes

**Focus:** Show how a build macro can take a big-picture look at the whole class, and generate new functions that give your class super powers.

**Problem:** You are a sysadmin, and have to create a tonne of small command line utilities.  But you always end up just using `Sys.args()` and never remember which arguments you are supposed to use where, and your utilities get lost and confused.

**Can we solve it without macros:** Maybe.  We could use Haxe RTTI to read information at runtime, but thatâ€™s even harder than maros.  We could just list the functions on the object, but then we have no documentation.  We could have a separate UI function that sets up the menus based on us sending it commands + help tips, but this would require being updated separately to the code, so may not always be up to date.

**Code Example:** Have a file with some public methods that do something actually useful.  Perhaps a haxelib helper, that updates your haxelib.json, bundles a zip, and submits it.  Each person has to write a build function that finds each of the functions, and creates a useable, documented command line interface for the functions.
