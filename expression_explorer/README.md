# Expression Explorer

## Key lesson: Everything is an expression (almost)

**Focus:** Understanding ExprDef and Expressions in general.

**Aim:** Create an understanding that macros deal with expressions, not values.  Help people begin to see how everyday Haxe syntax becomes the enums in `haxe.macro.ExprDef`.

**Code example:** A simple project that uses `macro some.expression()` and shows you the resulting enum, and allows you to practice switching on it.  Just do everything at runtime.
